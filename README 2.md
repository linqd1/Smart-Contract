# Install

```
go get -u github.com/qtumproject/solar/cli/solar
```

`solar` assumes that the [Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) is already installed.

# Prototype for Smart Contract deployment tool

## QTUM

Start qtumd in regtest mode:

```
qtumd -regtest -rpcuser=howard -rpcpassword=yeh
```

Use env variable to specify the local qtumd RPC node:

```
export QTUM_RPC=http://howard:yeh@localhost:13889
```

## QTUM Docker

You can run qtumd with docker, which comes bundled with solar (and `solc`):

```
docker run -it --rm \
  --name myapp \
  -v `pwd`:/dapp \
  -p 3889:3889 \
  hayeah/qtumportal
```

Then you enter into the container by running:

```
docker exec -it myapp sh
```

## Ethereum

Start an Ethereum node, with RPC service:

```
geth --rpc --rpcapi "eth,miner,personal" --datadir "./" --nodiscover console
```

Set the RPC endpoint, with your account address and password:

```
export ETH_RPC=http://$accountAddress:$accountPassword@localhost:8545
```

Specify a deployment environment.

```
# The environment is `development` by default
export SOLAR_ENV=development
```

## ganache-cli

Start ganache with a fixed seed:

```
ganache-cli -d testrpc -b 3
```

```
export ETH_RPC=http://0x90f8bf6a479f320ead074411a4b0e7944ea8c9c1:@localhost:8545
```

## Parity Dev Chain

For development purposes, an alternative to geth or testrpc is the parity dev chain. It supports instantaneous mining, and pre-generates an account already funded with Ether.

```
parity \
  --chain dev \
  --jsonrpc-hosts all \
  --jsonrpc-interface all \
  --ws-interface all \
  --rpcport 8545 \
  --no-discovery \
  --max-peers=2 \
  --min-peers=0 \
  --geth
```

The magic account pre-generated account is `0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72`. The password is the empty string.

Configure ETH_RPC like this:

```
export ETH_RPC=http://0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72:@localhost:8545
```

# Deploy Contract

Suppose we have the following contract in `contracts/A.sol`:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

contract A {
  uint256 a;

  constructor(uint256 _a) public {
    a = _a;
  }
}
```

Use the `deploy` command to create the contract. The constructor parameters may be passed in as a JSON array:

```
$ solar deploy contracts/A.sol '[100]'
🚀  All contracts confirmed
deployed contracts/A.sol => 2672931f2f07b67383a4aec80fb6504727145e8c
```

> Note: On a real network it would take longer to deploy. For development locally it is instantenous.

You should see the address and ABI saved in a JSON file named `solar.development.json`:

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "contracts/A.sol": {
      "source": "contracts/A.sol:A",
      "abi": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "type": "constructor",
          "payable": false,
          "inputs": [
            {
              "name": "_a",
              "type": "uint256",
              "indexed": false
            }
          ],
          "outputs": null,
          "constant": false,
          "anonymous": false
        }
      ],
      "bin": "60606040523415600e57600080fd5b604051602080606783398101604052808051600055505060358060326000396000f3006060604052600080fd00a165627a7a72305820cd047550e6b1a360fc0f2de526c2f6f0150d249efca0b5820d6050c935e129370029",

      "name": "A",
      "deployName": "contracts/A.sol",
      "address": "2672931f2f07b67383a4aec80fb6504727145e8c",
      "txid": "dc36ebb365033f557367c88e4bad2f4c726a609e8a4cc0d5751ff4cab9187a51",

    }
  },
  "libraries": {},
  "related": {}
}
```

The contract's deploy name defaults to the contract's file name. You can't deploy using the same name twice.

```
$ solar deploy contracts/A.sol
❗️  deploy contract name already used: contracts/A.sol
```

Add the flag `--force` to redeploy a contract:

```
$ solar deploy contracts/A.sol '[200]' --force
🚀  All contracts confirmed
   deployed contracts/A.sol => 3b566019c5e69e3c33c4609b51597b4b83b00e74
```

In `solar.development.json` you should see that the address had changed.

## Naming A Contract

By default the file name is used as the deploy name. We can change the deploy name to `Ace` by appending it after the file name:

```
$ solar deploy contracts/A.sol:Ace '[300]'
🚀  All contracts confirmed
   deployed Ace => 38dfbad58cb340815e649242fc7514fe1fa54e7d
```

The deploy name must be unique. Deploy should fail if the a name is used twice:

```
$ solar deploy contracts/A.sol:Ace '[300]'
❗️  deploy contract name already used: Ace
```

## Deploy A Library

Sometimes your contract may depend on a library, which requires linking when deploying. The most frequently used library is maybe `SafeMath.lib`.

```
solar deploy contracts/SafeMathLib.sol --lib

🚀  All contracts confirmed
   deployed contracts/SafeMathLib.sol => 26fe40c433b4d109299660284eaa475b95462342
```

Then deploying other contracts that reference `SafeMathLib` will automatically link to this deployed instance.
